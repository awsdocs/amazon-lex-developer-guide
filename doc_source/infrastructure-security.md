# Infrastructure Security in Amazon Lex<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, Amazon Lex is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper\.

You use published AWS API calls to access Amazon Lex through the network\. Clients must support TLS \(Transport Layer Security\) 1\.0\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\), such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems, such as Java 7 and later, support these modes\. Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

You can call these API operations from any network location, but Amazon Lex supports resource\-level access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address\. You can also use Amazon Lex policies to control access from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) endpoints or specific VPCs\. Effectively, this isolates network access to a given Amazon Lex resource from only the specific VPC within the AWS network\.
