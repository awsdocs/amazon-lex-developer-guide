# DeleteUtterances<a name="API_DeleteUtterances"></a>

Deletes stored utterances\.

Amazon Lex stores the utterances that users send to your bot\. Utterances are stored for 15 days for use with the [GetUtterancesView](API_GetUtterancesView.md) operation, and then stored indefinitely for use in improving the ability of your bot to respond to user input\.

Use the `DeleteUtterances` operation to manually delete stored utterances for a specific user\. When you use the `DeleteUtterances` operation, utterances stored for improving your bot's ability to respond to user input are deleted immediately\. Utterances stored for use with the `GetUtterancesView` operation are deleted after 15 days\.

This operation requires permissions for the `lex:DeleteUtterances` action\.
