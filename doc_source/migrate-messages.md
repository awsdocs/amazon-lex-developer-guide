During migration, Amazon Lex may find resources, such as built\-in slot types, that it can't migrate to the equivalent Amazon Lex V2 resource\. When this happens, Amazon Lex returns a migration message that describes what happened and provides a link to the documentation that tells you how to fix the migration issue\. The following sections describe the issues that might arise when you are migrating a bot and how to fix the issue\.
